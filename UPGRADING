AGAVI UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
============================

Upgrading to 1.1 Series from 1.0 Series
=======================================

Response
--------
If you are using custom implementations of AgaviResponse, please make sure to update the merge() method to call parent::merge(). This method was previously declared abstract, but since Agavi 1.1 it contains the necessary code to perform merging of response attributes.
